## Another one?!

Tic Tac Toe apps have apparently replaced TODO lists in recent years. My implementation predates [the official "Intro to React" Tic Tac Toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) by [~5 months](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/commit/aa9544bfac6603aa7e7ab978be97011ad4d64012#diff-3ccbede9e75746bc98284acd56d132a9) and takes a different approach. Over time, this project has become my "keep up with React best practices" test bed: its state management and user interactivity is just complex enough to kick the tires on new React releases and adjust as necessary.

## Docker + VS Code

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed, you can work with this project as a [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container):

1. Clone project & open project directory in VS Code
3. Follow `devcontainer` auto-detection prompts or run `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` command
4. Once attached to remote container in VS Code, run `npm start` via [integrated VS Code terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
6. Modify project & see changes reflected live
